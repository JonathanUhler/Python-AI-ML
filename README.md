# Python AI-ML

A dive into basic machine learning in Python 3. Project made for comp sci final exam.


# Dependencies
Python 3 or higher - https://www.python.org/downloads/   |   pip (used to install packages and APIs) - https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/   |   Keras (neural network API) - https://pypi.org/project/Keras/   |   NumPy (data handler) - https://numpy.org/install/   |   MatPlotLib (for displaying data using a GUI) - https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/users/installing.html


# Installation
Install Keras and NumPy.
Clone or download the KerasPredictor.py file as well as the training data .csv file.
Using the change directory command, move to the directory with the file.
In terminal or command-line, use "python3 KerasPredictor.py" Because of the number of layers and the size of training data, the network may take some time to begin return epochs.


# PredictorCongif.json
In order to change the properties of the predictor (e.g. the input file, whether the visualizer is enabled, etc.) open the PredictorConfig.json file and change the elements. The elements are: input file, data seperation character, output layer width, and visualizer enabler.
